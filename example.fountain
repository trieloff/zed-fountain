# ACT I

## OPENING SEQUENCE

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy coffee shop in downtown. SARAH (30s) sits at a corner table, typing furiously on her laptop.

[[Note: The coffee shop should feel modern but cozy]]

JOHN (O.S.)
Sarah? Sarah Martinez?

Sarah looks up, surprised.

SARAH
(uncertain)
John? John from college?

JOHN
(grinning)
The one and only!

John approaches the table. He's carrying a large coffee and a briefcase.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Mind if I join you?

SARAH
Of course! Please, sit down.

John sits across from her.

SARAH (CONT'D)
I can't believe it's been, what, ten years?

JOHN
Closer to twelve, actually.

They both laugh, a moment of shared nostalgia.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The coffee shop is now quieter. Sarah and John are deep in conversation.

JOHN
So you're saying you never finished that novel?

SARAH
(defensive)
It's not that simple. Life got in the way.

JOHN
Life always gets in the way. The question is, are you going to let it?

Sarah considers this, her expression thoughtful.

FADE OUT.

# ACT II

## THE CONFRONTATION

EXT. PARK - SUNSET

Sarah walks alone through the park, lost in thought.

[[Note: Golden hour lighting is crucial here]]

She pulls out her phone and dials.

SARAH
(into phone)
Mom? I need to tell you something.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
