# ACT ONE

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

Rain hammers the sidewalk. Puddles reflect neon signs and brake lights. Morning commuters hurry past with newspapers held overhead as makeshift umbrellas.

MAYA (28) stands alone at the bus stop, her coffee cup steaming in the cold air. She checks her phone: 7:28 AM. Still time. She scrolls, sighs.

The bus ROARS past without stopping, spraying dirty water across the curb.

MAYA
(frustrated!)
Perfect!

She wipes water from her coat sleeve, then notices someone approaching from the corner.

JAMES (30) jogs up, equally soaked, his tie askew. He carries essential items: a broken umbrella, a soggy briefcase, and wounded pride.

JAMES
Did the seven-thirty just...?

MAYA
Yeah. Didn't even slow down.

They stand in awkward silence. The rain continues its percussion on the metal shelter roof.

JAMES
(offering the broken umbrella)
This was supposed to help.

MAYA
(laughing!)
What happened?

JAMES
Underestimated the wind.
(pause)
Or overestimated the umbrella.

She smiles. He notices her coffee cup.

JAMES (CONT'D)
Is that from Marco's?

MAYA
You know it?

JAMES
Best espresso in three blocks.

MAYA
Try five blocks.

Their phones BUZZ simultaneously - the bus app notification. Both check the screen. The display shows the same message: DELAYED 20 MIN. Both groan.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Twenty minute delay.

JAMES
In this weather, probably thirty.

MAYA
(suddenly decisive!)
Marco's is two blocks that way!
They have a fireplace.

JAMES
(considering)
And espresso.

MAYA
And actual working umbrellas you
can borrow.

JAMES
Sold.

They step out into the rain together, walking quickly. The abandoned bus stop shelter fills with water as a drain clogs with leaves.

INT. MARCO'S CAFÉ - CONTINUOUS

Warm amber light. The FIREPLACE crackles. Maya and James sit at a corner table with their coffees. Her laptop is open, covered in linguistics notes.

JAMES
What are you working on?

MAYA
(scrolling through notes)
Dissertation. Proto-Indo-European
phonology.

JAMES
Proto-what-now?

MAYA
(excited!)
The reconstructed ancestor of most
European languages. Want to hear
some?

JAMES
(curious!)
Why not?

MAYA
(in PIE, carefully)
*Ḱwón̥ h₁ésti. *Só h₁nḗr káput.
(A dog is. The man has-head.)

She laughs at his confused expression.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Okay, try this one.
(in PIE, dramatically)
*Wékʷos kleutōr! *Wékʷos kleutōr!
(Words are-heard! Words are-heard!)

JAMES
That's... actually kind of cool.

MAYA
Right? Six thousand years old and
we can still reconstruct it.

The rain pounds against the window. Neither notices the bus rolling past outside.

>FADE OUT.
